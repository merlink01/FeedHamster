Offline Feed Reader for Gnome

This Progam is both:
A library (class_feedhamster.py) and a Gnome Gui Application.

The target is to create an Offline Feedreader that saves the whole 
contents of the Feeds in SQLite Database Files.

Instead of normal Feedreaders you have the Possibility to read the whole
content of the message without internet connection.

Also a plugin Support is included to create different sources for your feeds.

At this Time RSS and Audio/Video Podcasts are supported.

Also Twitter, Facebook or other sources could be created an easy way.
